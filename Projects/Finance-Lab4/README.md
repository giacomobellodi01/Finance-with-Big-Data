# Predicting Stock Returns with Machine Learning

This project applies **machine learning techniques** to predict short-, medium-, and long-term stock returns using daily price and volume data. The goal is to evaluate how data-driven models can improve return forecasting and portfolio performance compared to traditional regression-based approaches.

### Key Tasks
- Importing and analyzing stock **price and volume** data  
- Building **OLS** and **Ridge Regression** models to predict returns  
- Comparing model accuracy using **Out-of-Sample R² (ROOS)** and sign-matching metrics  
- Extending the analysis with **Neural Networks** and **Tree-based models**  
- Constructing and testing an **AI-driven trading portfolio**, including transaction cost adjustments  

### Methodology
1. **Data Preparation** — Merge and scale stock prices and volumes for multiple securities.  
2. **Model Training** — Train models over various time horizons (5-, 20-, 60-day returns).  
3. **Performance Evaluation** — Assess predictive performance and stability across assets.  
4. **Portfolio Simulation** — Rebalance portfolios based on predicted returns and compare with random benchmarks.
