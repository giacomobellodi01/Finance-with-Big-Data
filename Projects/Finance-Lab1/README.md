## Applied Portfolio Theory

This project explores **portfolio optimization** using real stock market data. It involves importing and analyzing S&P 500 stock prices, calculating returns, and evaluating correlations among assets. The analysis culminates in simulating random portfolios to identify the tangency portfolio that maximizes the Sharpe ratio.

Key tasks include:

- Data cleaning, visualization, and normalization
- Computation of daily returns and correlations
- **Simulation of portfolios** and construction of the efficient frontier
