## Applying the CAPM

This project applies the **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)** to real stock market data to estimate and interpret **systematic risk (beta)** and **abnormal returns (alpha)** for selected S&P 500 assets. It combines financial theory with empirical analysis, demonstrating how the CAPM can be tested and visualized using Python.

### Key Tasks
- Visualizing daily stock returns against the market to assess correlations  
- Running OLS regressions to estimate **alpha** and **beta** for multiple assets  
- Comparing predicted vs. realized returns to evaluate CAPM performance  
- Simulating a high-risk portfolio based on estimated betas
