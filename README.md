## Finance with Big-Data

This repository contains the projects developed during the **Finance with Big Data** course at Bocconi University.  
Each project applies data science and quantitative finance techniques — from portfolio optimization and CAPM estimation to machine learning and ESG event analysis — to explore real-world financial datasets and decision-making frameworks.
